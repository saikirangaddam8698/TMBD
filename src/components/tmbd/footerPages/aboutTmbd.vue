                The Movie Database (TMDB) is a community built movie and TV database. Every piece of data has been added
                by
                our amazing community dating back to 2008. TMDB's strong international focus and breadth of data is
                largely
                unmatched and something we're incredibly proud of. Put simply, we live and breathe community and that's
                precisely what makes us different.s

                Every year since 2008, the number of contributions to our database has increased (check out our last
                years wrap!) With over 1,500,000 developers and companies using our platform, TMDB has become a premiere
                source for metadata.</p>

            <p>Along with extensive metadata for movies, TV shows and people, we also offer one of the best selections
                of high resolution posters and backdrops. On average, over 1,000 images are added every single day.</p>
