    TMDB aims to be a high quality and trusted source of entertainment data. As such, contributions that don't follow the guidelines outlined broadly in the bible will be removed. Repeated offenders will be banned.

We reserve the right to ban any account or person that violates these guidelines and engages in spam or data sabotage. This includes making edits that are deliberately incorrect, using vulgar or offensive language in edits or metadata fields, adding fake/trolling content, linking to illegal streaming websites, and misusing TMDB to promote your own websites/apps/YouTube channels.

As a general rule we expect everyone to follow a few simple rules:

Respect everyone, we're all here because we have something in common.
Be polite and welcoming to new users. We were all new once.
Ask for help and provide assistance to others when possible.
Offer constructive criticism or voice a dissenting opinion, but don't be mean or disrespectful.
Lead by example. Treat others even better than you expect to be treated yourself and the discussions become a better place for everyone.
On the other hand, some examples of contributions we do not tolerate:

Do not post vulgar or offensive language.
Do not post or ask for links to copyrighted, non-fair use material.
Do not post any NSFW* content (e.g. links, images, text etc.) anywhere other than within the adult section of TMDB.
Trolling, abuse, flaming and/or harassment (e.g. personal attacks, name-calling and/or insulting/ridiculing another user) are uncalled for and will not be tolerated.
Do not post spam or advertisements on TMDB.
Offensive or distasteful usernames are unnecessary and will either be changed or banned. One account per person is enough. Multiples are unnecessary and will be banned and/or removed. But most importantly; "Be nice or go home!"

[*] Content that might be considered offensive or too sexually explicit for the wide range of age groups within the TMDB user base. This includes, but is not limited to: erotic (e.g. nudity, implied sexual acts), excessively violent (e.g. gore, torture), bigoted (irrationally hateful content aimed at, or relating to, a group or individual) and harmful (e.g. those flashing seizure images) content.
